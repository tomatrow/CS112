Fleshout Programming Project 8.5. Give new definitions for the various constructors and methods center, draw, and erase of the class Figure; draw and erase of the class Triangle; and draw and erase of the class Rectangle. Use character graphics; that is, the various draw methods will place regular keyboard characters on the screen in the desired shape. Use the character '\*' for all the character graphics. That way, the draw methods actually draw figures on the screen by placing the character '\*' at suitable locations on the screen. For the erase methods, you can simply clear the screen (by outputting blank lines or by doing something more sophisticated). There are a lot of details in this project and you will have to decide on some of them on your own.
