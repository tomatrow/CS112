Consider a graphics system that has classes for various figures—say, rectangles, boxes, triangles, circles, and so on. For example, a rectangle might have data members’ height, width, and center point, while a box and circle might have only a center point and an edge length or radius, respectively. In a well-designed system, these would be derived from a common class, `Figure`. You are to implement such a system.

The class `Figure` is the base class. You should add only `Rectangle` and `Triangle` classes derived from `Figure`. Each class has stubs for methods erase and draw. Each of these methods outputs a message telling the name of the class and what method has been called. Because these are just stubs, they do nothing more than output this message. The method `center` calls the erase and draw methods to `erase` and `redraw` the figure at the center. Because you have only stubs for `erase` and `draw`, `center` will not do any “centering” but will call the methods `erase` and `draw`, which will allow you to see which versions of draw and `center` it calls. Also, add an output message in the method `center` that announces that `center` is being called. The methods should take no arguments. Also, define a demonstration program for your classes.

For a real example, you would have to replace the definition of each of these methods with code to do the actual drawing. You will be asked to do this in Programming Project 8.6.
