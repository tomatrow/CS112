Write a program that uses an ArrayList of parameter type Contact to store a database of contacts. The Contact class should store the contact’s first and last name, phone number, and email address. Add appropriate accessor and mutator methods. Your database program should present a menu that allows the user to add a contact, display all contacts, search for a specific contact and display it, or search for a specific contact and give the user the option to delete it. The searches should find any contact where any instance variable contains a target search string. For example, if “elmore” is the search target, then any contact where the first name, last name, phone number, or email address contains “elmore” should be returned for display or deletion. Use the “for-each” loop to iterate through the ArrayList.
