Design and code a Swing GUI for a two-player tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) game on a 3 * 3 game board. The JFrame should use a BorderLayout with a JLabel in the NORTH region to display messages (e.g., who won the game), and a JPanel in the CENTER region to display the game board. For the game board in the JPanel, use a GridLayout manager with a 3 * 3 layout of JButton’s in each cell to display the game board. The button labels should initially be blank. When a player clicks on an empty button, an appropriate “X” or “O” should be placed in the label field of the button. If there is a winner (three in a row), then the program should display the winner in the JLabel located at the top of the window. If all nine cells have been filled without a winner, the program should indicate that there is a tie.
