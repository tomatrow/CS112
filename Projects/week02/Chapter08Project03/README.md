Extend the previous problem with a Rental class. This class should store a Movie that is rented, an integer representing the ID of the customer that rented the movie, and an integer indicating how many days late the movie is. Add a method that calculates the late fees for the rental. In your main method, create an array of type Rental filled with sample data of all types of movies. Then, create a method named lateFeesOwed that iterates through the array and returns the total amount of late fees that are outstanding.
