â€‹Write a program that reads a file of numbers of type int and outputs all the numbers to another file, but without any duplicate numbers. Assume that the input file is sorted from smallest first to largest last. After the program is run, the new file will contain all the numbers in the original file, but no number will appear more than once in the file. The numbers in the output file should also be sorted from smallest to largest. Your program should obtain both file names from the user. Use a text file that stores one number per line.
